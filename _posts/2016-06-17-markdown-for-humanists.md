I recently got a new computer, so of course I am revisiting and reevaluating my work flow. The last time I did this was several years ago and the landscape has changed significantly. My former workflow went something like this:

1. Write LaTeX code using EMacs and AucTex
2. Fiddle with obscure Latex formatting to get things looking just so
3. Submit PDF
4. Someone needs the file in .doc or .docx, because I'm a humanities scholar and that's how most people work in my field
5. Try to remember the rather obscure process for converting LaTeX to .odt using tex4ht
6. Think I have it figured out, run the conversion. Bibliography is eaten.
7. Swear colorfully.
8. Repeat steps 5 through 7 a few times. 
9. Remember that the only way to get the bibliography to work is to use a version of LaTeX from 2010.
10. Find the flash drive with that version and install it since I've overwritten it for some reason.
11. Run conversion again and pray.
12. It worked! Import into LibreOffice.
13. Fiddle with mangled styles for hours.
14. Save to .docx and send to appropriate person.

This is, as I'm sure you can see, rather painful. The actual writing part is fine. I love working in plain text with a proper programming editor. It's just that in the past sharing things with peers has been... challenging. 

So why did I put up with that for an embarrassingly long time? Because the temptation is to spend more time tweaking workflow than actually writing. Despite the irritation and expletives involved in steps 4 through 14, it got the job done. But with an upgrade in my working computer, the move from Linux to a Mac (which is another post all together), and getting the funding to finish my book, I have a reason to re-evaluate how I work. And there have been a lot of good changes. 

The last time I looked at Markdown the support for citations was virtually non-existant. Oh, the joy when I ran across [this article](https://medium.com/@chriskrycho/academic-markdown-and-citations-fe562ff443df#.68u9kyn7q) discussing how to use Markdown and Pandoc with bibtex to produce Chicago style footnotes. Bliss.

So anyway, I am changing my workflow from LaTeX to Markdown and while there have been some bumps, I think it will be a very good change.
